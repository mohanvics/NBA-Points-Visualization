# NBA-Points-Visualization
- Created a heatmap to visualize the NBA's All-Time leaders in points scored (each box represents average points per game in a given season)
- I used BeautifulSoup to scrape the data from https://www.basketball-reference.com/

- It'll be interesting to see if LeBron James will continue to score over 24 points per game in his 18th+ season. It is important to note that LeBron James is currently averaging 24.3 points per game through 12 games (at the time of writing) in the 2019/2020 NBA season. Expect to see this number change as the season progresses.
